## Connecting the Dots

One of Jobs' most famous lessons is to trust that the dots will connect in your future. In his 2005 Stanford commencement address, he encouraged graduates to pursue what they love, even if the path isn't clear.

> "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards."

## Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish

Jobs' legacy is a reminder to always stay curious, take risks, and never settle. His mantra, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish," continues to inspire creators, entrepreneurs, and dreamers worldwide.
